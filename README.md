# What is this?

WSLiveEditor is a helpful tool for quick testing levels that are generated programmatically by a tool, by opening a Websocket Server it allows to remove old objects and add new ones without needing to re-open the editor or restart the game.

Up on entering the editor, a websocket server will be opened on `127.0.0.1:1313`
